This generates wand events in the standard wand format.  To calibrate,
hold the 'move' button while pointing the wand at the center of the
main feld.

Usage: 'main'.

Current limitations:
* Hard-codes the center and wand position.
* Also hard-codes disabling the camera support.
* Only handles one wand.
* Relies on library internals for polling.
